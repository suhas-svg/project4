Project Title: Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Safety through Real-time User Health Monitoring and Various factors Integration

Description:
Developing a safety-centric solution for autonomous vehicles, this project focuses on monitoring intoxication levels, respiratory rate,
heart rate, BMI, and sleepiness of passengers. The challenge is to design an advisory control system that dynamically responds to these factors, 
ensuring a secure and comfortable experience in autonomous transportation.

Contribution:
Me and Manohar are responsible for the design of advisory control and fuzzy logics used in the project. 

Pre requisites:
Intall MATLAB with Simulink add-on
Make sure that all dependancies and files are in the same directory for the project to run.

Usage: 
Open the obstacletype.m and give in the static or dynamic obstacle. The code runs according to the user selection.
From here on follow the on screen instructions to give user inputs.

Configuration: 
Configure the Simulink models to simulate in regular time intervals. This can be done by going into 
model settings --> solver selection --> type : fixed time interval
